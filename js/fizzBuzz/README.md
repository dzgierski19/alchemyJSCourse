Fizz Buzz
Write a function fizzBuzz that takes an array of numbers and replaces any number divisible by three with the word "fizz" and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". If a number is divisible by both three and five, replace it with "fizzbuzz"

Once the appropriate numbers are replaced, return a concatenated string with only the words "fizz" or "buzz" included.

const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, 20];

fizzBuzz(numbers); // returns "fizzbuzzfizzfizzbuzz"
